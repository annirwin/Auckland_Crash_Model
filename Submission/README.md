# Auckland Traffic Crash Model

## 158755 Project 4 - Group 1

  
## Introduction:
This project aims to create a model to predict vehicle crashes in Auckland City. Developing a predictive model for vehicle crashes in Auckland has several use cases. This information can be used to either plan resource allocation, such as police traffic monitoring or emergency/hospital service rosters or target certain areas with preventative measures, such as speed camera monitoring.

## Datasets used:
Crash Analysis System (CAS) - Waka Kotahi
State Highway Traffic Volumes - Waka Kotahi
Population counts - United Nations - World Population Prospects
Open-Meteo Weather API

## Project code files:
- "Main_Notebook.ipynb" - This is the main script containing the development of the predictive model and the creation of predictions for the inference data.
- "Data preparations.ipynb" - This script processes the raw data from the data sources.
- "Prepare cas dataset for modeling and inference.ipynb" - This script performs data wrangling and prepares the datasets for modelling and inference.
- "Weather_1.3.ipynb" - This script extracts and prepares weather data for the predictive model and organises the prediction data to show on a map in streamlit.
- "Streamlit_Map_SA2.py" - This is the code for the streamlit app.
