# Auckland Traffic Crash Model

## Introduction:
This project aims to create a model that can predict vehicle crashes in Auckland City. Developing a predictive model for vehicle crashes in Auckland has several use cases. This information can be used to either plan resource allocation, such as police traffic monitoring or emergency/hospital service rosters or target certain areas with preventative measures, such as speed camera monitoring.

## Datasets used:
