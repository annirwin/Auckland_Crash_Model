# Auckland Crash Model
Massey University, New Zealand 158.755 2024 - Project 4

### Model:

Create a model that can predict vehicle crashes in Auckland City. 

### Datasets:

- Crash Analysis System - Waka Kotahi 

- Auckland Transport Traffic Counts 

- Weather Source

### Research Questions:

1. The purposes of creating a model are so that we can predict two research goals:

2. Identify crash hotspots in the Auckland roading network and factors that predict a high crash risk. It is Information that can be used to plan resources such as Police traffic monitoring or emergency services and hospital service rosters. There are well known high risk periods such as higher traffic volumes on public holidays periods, the aim is to broaden the model to predict a range of hotspots and identify the factors that contribute to them. 
Assess the various Government policies proposals related to reducing speed limits on streets around school areas in Auckland to predict a reduction in either the severity or frequency of crashes.

### Output: 
Create a GIS visualisation artefact, Streamlit application
