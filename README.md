# Auckland Crash Model
Massey University, New Zealand 158.755 2024 - Project 4

### Model:

Develop a predictive model that identifies high-risk areas for vehicle crashes in Auckland​.

### Datasets:
- Crash Analysis System - Waka Kotahi
- State Highway Traffic Volumes - Waka Kotahi
- Population counts - United Nations - World Population Prospects
- Open-Meteo Weather API ​

### Research Questions:
Develop a predictive model that identifies high-risk areas for vehicle crashes in Auckland​.
